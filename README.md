# Ley Lines
Ley Lines is a node graph editor framework for Unity that allows for a variety
of uses.

For developers, Ley Lines simplifies the process of writing a specialized node
graph editor. For example, a person writing a shader editor or an AI decision
plugin can use this library to simplify the otherwise tedious process of
writing the code to render a node graph in Unity.

The default configuration of Ley Lines allows developers _and_ non-developers
to quickly iterate and create simple run-time behaviours (ex. actions to take
when a player enters a trigger volume). This framework also allows for the
sequencing of events, which is typically time-consuming to create manually.

The overall advantage of this framework is to open up Unity to allow artists
and level designers to create simple behaviours without programmer
intervention.
